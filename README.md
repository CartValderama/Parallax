This React app uses `@react-spring/parallax` to create an interactive scrolling experience with layered backgrounds that move at different speeds, giving a 3D effect. It also utilizes the Intersection Observer API to detect when certain sections are in view, triggering animations and revealing content dynamically.

Key features include:
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Creates depth with multiple layers moving at different speeds.
- **Intersection Observer**: Reveals game options (Hangman and Quiz) as the user scrolls to the relevant section.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

This project is perfect for learning advanced React hooks, parallax effects, and responsive design.
